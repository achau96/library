# library

Learning Objectives
1. Object basics. No inheritance used here.
2. Array basics including use of map.
3. A lot of CSS. (Very annoying as a beginner)
More people should complain about CSS, it's not easy.
4. A lot of DOM Manipulation.

What Did I struggle with?
1. Making a modal. (The popup) - Took about 1.5-2 hours to get properly.
2. Originally went for a card look but it was really ugly, so
decided to go for a table look.
3. Using indexOf (took me 15-20 mins to realize it did not type coerce to
a number by itself). Got too comfortable with being lazy with JS.
4. Everything is in my addToLibrary Function and it makes me uncomfortable,
but I don't want to try refactoring in case things break at the moment.
